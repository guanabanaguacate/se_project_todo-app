# Simple Todo App

Online customizable to-do list.

## Functionality

This project allows users to customize a to-do list, add and remove items and add a check next to them as they are completed. As users create new to-do's, they can also provide the expected date that they should be finished with them, and that date appears next to each todo item.

## Technology

Give a description of the technologies and techniques used. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features are recommended.

This project was created using html, css and javascript functionalities and is interactive based on users behavior. The code is optimized and restructured for better organization among both CSS and JavaScript classes. For example, a "Todo" class is created from JavaScript and includes both public and private methods. 

Validation is used in order to determine whether or not a user has or hasn't done something, and then the code responds accordingly.
